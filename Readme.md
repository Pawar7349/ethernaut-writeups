# Ethernaut Solutions

Writeups from solving Ethernaut to build smart-contract security skills.

## What this is
Ethernaut is a Web3 CTF focused on Ethereum contract vulnerabilities. Each level has a vulnerable contract that must be exploited.

## Structure
- `ethernaut-notes.md` - short writeups per level (Bug -> Exploit -> Fix)
- `console-snippets.md` - browser console + hardhat snippets per level
- `attack-scripts.md` - exploit contracts/scripts used
- `Readme.md` - overview

## How to use these notes
- Start with `ethernaut-notes.md` to get the idea, then jump to `console-snippets.md`
- If a level needs a contract, check `attack-scripts.md`
- I keep these short on purpose; the goal is to remember the trick, not rewrite the docs

## Tools used
- Remix (quick testing)
- Foundry (most exploits)
- Hardhat (some levels)
- Web3 console / Cast (storage reads, raw tx)

Educational use only.
