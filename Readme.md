# Ethernaut Solutions

Writeups from solving Ethernaut to build smart-contract security skills.

## What this is
Ethernaut is a Web3 CTF focused on Ethereum contract vulnerabilities. Each level has a vulnerable contract that must be exploited.

## Structure
- `ethernaut-notes.md` - short writeups per level (Bug -> Exploit -> Fix)
- `attack-scripts.md` - exploit contracts/scripts used
- `Readme.md` - overview

## Tools used
- Remix (quick testing)
- Foundry (most exploits)
- Hardhat (some levels)
- Web3 console / Cast (storage reads, raw tx)
